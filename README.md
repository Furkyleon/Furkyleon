## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior Computer Science and Engineering student at SabancÄ± University with a talent for designing and solving problems. I was a member of the Student Representative Committee and took part in student clubs like IEEE and IES as a designer. I pay attention to detail in assignments and projects, work well in a team, and always aim to do my best.

I am interested in both frontend and backend development and enjoy designing user interfaces using frontend technologies. I am currently learning and improving my skills in these areas and plan to pursue a career in this field in the future.
